<!--Post Body-->
<p>Apache Storm is a platform for distributed, real-time computation that has been undergoing incubation at Apache since September 18, 2013. You can contribute by helping establish the Storm brand by submitting a proposal for the Apache Storm logo.</p>
<p>Your proposal will be published on the <a href="http://storm.incubator.apache.org" target="_blank">Storm project website</a> next to the other proposals. On <strong>Wednesday, April 30, 2014</strong> the community will choose the new logo through a vote on the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-storm-dev/" target="_blank">Apache Storm Mailing List</a>. If more than 10 proposals are received, voting will take place in two rounds, with the first round selecting 10 proposals to move to round two.</p>
<p>The winning artist will be credited on the Apache Storm website as having designed the logo, and may include a link to her/his website or blog. Prizes for the winner(s) are currently TBD.</p>
<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
<p>The logo should meet the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Include 2 versions of the logo: a rectangular layout (full brand) and a square layout (icon, stand-alone logo) </li>

	<li>Translate to a 2-color representation (black/white, 2 greys, etc.) </li>
	<li>Able to be inverted if running on a dark background </li>
	<li>Comply with the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/" target="_blank">Apache branding requirements</a></li>
</ul>

			<li>Streams</li>
			<li>Trident</li>
			<li>Functions/Filters</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
