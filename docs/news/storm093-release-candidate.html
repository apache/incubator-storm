<p>We are pleased to announce that Apache Storm version 0.9.3 has reached the release candidate stage.  The latest release is 0.9.3-rc1.  We are moving closer to the GA release, so this is a good time to give this new 0.9.3 version a try!</p>
<p>Storm 0.9.3 is a maintenance release with bug fixes and better stability as summarized in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">0.9.3 changelog</a>.  On top of that version 0.9.3 continues to improve the integration with <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka/README.md" target="_blank">documentation of the core spout and Trident spout for Kafka</a>, which will provide our users with the best Kafka connectivity for Storm to date.</p>
<p>We heartily encourage you to <a href="downloads.html">test the 0.9.3 release candidate</a> and provide your feedback regarding any issues via <a href="http://storm.apache.org/community.html">our mailing lists</a>, which is an easy and valuable way to contribute back to the Storm community and to help us moving to an official 0.9.3 release.
