    <p>Storm provides hooks with which you can insert custom code to run on any number of events within Storm. You create a hook by extending the <a href="https://storm.apache.org/javadoc/apidocs/backtype/storm/hooks/BaseTaskHook.html" target="_blank">BaseTaskHook</a> class and overriding the appropriate method for the event you want to catch. There are two ways to register your hook:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the open method of your spout or prepare method of your bolt using the <a href="https://storm.apache.org/javadoc/apidocs/backtype/storm/task/TopologyContext.html" target="_blank">TopologyContext#addTaskHook</a> method.</li>
<li>Through the Storm configuration using the <a href="https://storm.apache.org/javadoc/apidocs/backtype/storm/Config.html#TOPOLOGY_AUTO_TASK_HOOKS" target="_blank">"topology.auto.task.hooks"</a> config. These hooks are automatically registered in every spout or bolt, and are useful for doing things like integrating with a custom monitoring system.</li>
